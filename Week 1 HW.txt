Hello! Welcome again to learning Python! :)

For this week I want you to keep some of the simple ideas we have learned in mind.
Can you list out 3 examples of INTs, 3 examples of STRINGs, and 3 examples of 
FLOATs? 

In a few sentences, can you also explain why you think we might need all of these 
data types (by the way, there are a lot more â€“ we have just scratched the 
surface!)? What might be some examples of when we use each type?

See you on Monday!

ANSWERS

INTs
- 5
- 1
- -1

STRINGs
- "Hello world"
- "Fifty thousand"
- "Ten"
- "Negative eight"
- "Hi my name is Caleb"
- "Hi, how are you?"

FLOATs
- 5.6
- 5.5
- -5.5
- 3.5
- 3.6
- 3.7

We would use different data types for different cases, depending on what the problem wants us to do. For example, INTs can be used to count. STRINGs can be used to say things. FLOATs can be used for the rating for a restaurant, for instance.
