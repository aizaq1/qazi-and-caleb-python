Hello! Welcome again to learning Python! :)

For this week I want you to keep some of the simple ideas we have learned in mind.
 Can you list out 3 examples of INTs, 3 examples of STRINGs, and 3 examples of 
 FLOATs? 

In a few sentences, can you also explain why you think we might need all of these 
data types (by the way, there are a lot more â€“ we have just scratched the 
surface!)? What might be some examples of when we use each type?

See you on Monday!
