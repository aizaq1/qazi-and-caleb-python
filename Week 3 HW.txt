1. Can you make a program that asks the person their favorite TV show? The program will then say their favorite TV show back in a nice way. For example:

What is your favorite TV show? Avatar: The Last Airbender
Nice! I like Avatar: The Last Airbender, too!


2. Rewrite the same program above, using a formatted string (with f and {}).
